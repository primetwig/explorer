This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:primetwig/explorer.git
```

Then go to the project:

```bash
cd ./explorer
```

And install all deps:

```bash
npm ci
# or
yarn
```

Now you have 2 options:

Option 1 is to run a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Option 2 is to make a build and run it:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# or
yarn build
yarn start
```

Either option will bring up the local server, which you can use.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
